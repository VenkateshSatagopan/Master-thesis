Master-thesis work - "Sub-pixel CNN based Image Demosaicing" at the Technical university of munich
The aim of the thesis is to reduce computational complexity associated with camera processing pipeline and at the same time reconstruct the images devoid of artifacts. Various resnet based new convolutional neural network were proposed in order to achieve above goals.

The result of CNN models were benchmarked against the state of art results in terms of PSNR, MS-SSIM. For testing the models kodak and mcmaster demosaicing image dataset.
